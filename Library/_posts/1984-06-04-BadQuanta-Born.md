# My Birth

On June 4th, 1984, I was born in Reykjavik Iceland. I've been informed I was a big-fat baby. C-Sectioned; because my mother feared the size of my father's forehead and specifically requested it. 

Perhaps this is T.M.I.; but my mother did not believe in circumcision even though it was common in Iceland at the time.  I consider her pretty progressive for the stance
