## Greetings & Salutations fellow (carbon based)? lifeforms

You are probably aware that this is the github home page of BadQuanta.  

I'm just leaving the rest of the template here so this doesn't look some empty.

You can take a look at what I'm working on when I started this home page: [pixeldeck](https://github.com/badquanta/pixeldeck) but it's not in a working state at the time of this writing.

### About BadQuanta

Just some guy interested in programming a better future.

#### README.md

## Header 1.1: Where am I?
## Header 1.2: Who are you?
### Header 1.2.1: Can I leave now?
# Header 2: Oh, you're still here...

- Bulleted
- Outline
-- of what
--- I'm
-- going to cover

1. But, sometimes
2. Order is
3. Needed.

**Important** and _Emphasied_ concepts will be `encoded` to __highlight__ ___markdown___ languages. ____I don't know what else to do.____
