# A united future of peoples

We are similarly unique. Homongenously distinct. Our pasts differ; our presents are inequitable; and the status quo unstainable. Yet despite all this; our future remains and always was united. From many places we come; to one destination we go: The final frontier we call our universe. The future is all around us if we can but move on from our past traumas.
