# Linux: The kernel & distributions system

Linux has been an interest of my since about 1997 & 1998.
Around 1999 I was begining to use Linux on a daily basis.
The very first distribution I got my hands on was known as Mandrake Linux; and I believe it had just issued what it was calling 6.0. A bit later I learned distributions had all just jumped a revision number or two; it was quite a silly matter.

Mandrake Linux; for those who may be unaware; was simply based on Red-Hat linux. In it I got to know Gnome; K.D.E.; and the very nascent X.F.C.E. which to this very day I kinda miss. A few years prior to using Linux on a daily basis in 1999, I had gotten the chance to upload my first website to Geocities. There I learned about ftp, eventually "unix commands" like chmod. Through CGI and CGI scripts in perl; bash; and php I learned more about "unix" by Proxy.  Naturally, in 1999 when given the opportunity to take a "College Course" at night, even though I was just a sophmore in High-school; I jumped at the chance to take "Introduction to Unix System-V." A 101 level class; had to take some tests and I got some other tests waved due ot my age to qualify entrance. Anywho; as a 14 and newly 15 year old who'd just taken the plunge into Linux, was just learning about X11 and Linux networking.. this class was a natural fit.

Coming out of that class; and with the help of Linux-Howtos (ltdp.org); I began being able to do things like take an only machine we had, turn it into a modem controller, router, and file-sharing machine.  A few times I got the SAMBA server to act like my Domain server for the windows PCs that were around, but that didn't always making things easier at the time.. the tech was still new.

So many times I struggled to understand and deploy the "Yellow-Pages" server. Sometimes getting it to work; but always finding it brittle and having to eventually re-install distros.
